Instructions for Creating a Know Your Rights (KYR) Case Overview
Purpose: This guide is designed for individuals, legal aid providers, and volunteers to create a clear, actionable, and protective document that helps people understand and assert their rights. The document ensures confidentiality by avoiding any personal identifying information (PII).
Interactive Start: When an individual clicks the "What are my rights?" tab, it should automatically initiate the intake process. This proactive approach engages the user immediately with their primary concerns and sets the tone for a personalized interaction.
ðŸ“Œ Step 1: Gather Information About the Situation (Intake Process) Begin collecting essential facts to ensure the response is relevant and accurate. This step is critical in understanding the context of the individual's situation.
1A: Select Language Preference
Confirm the individualâ€™s preferred language before proceeding to ensure all legal terms and rights are accurately understood and communicated.
1B: Identify the Key Details of the Incident
Participants: Identify the entities involved (e.g., law enforcement, ICE, employer, landlord, school) without naming specific individuals.
Location: Describe where the incident occurred (e.g., home, workplace, public space) without specific addresses.
Description: Provide a neutral and factual summary of the events that transpired.
Concerns: Outline the primary concerns (e.g., detention, deportation, workplace retaliation) focusing on the main facts.
Risks: Note any immediate legal risks (e.g., pending deportation, arrest) that need addressing.
Urgency: Assess the urgency to prioritize immediate needs.
Follow-Up: Secure contact information for follow-up purposes while maintaining confidentiality.
ðŸ“Œ Step 2: Summarize the Situation Clearly Craft a concise, neutral, and generalized summary that makes the case easy to understand. This summary should adhere to the following principles:
âœ… Concise: Focus strictly on the main facts.
âœ… Neutral: Avoid any assumptions or unnecessary details.
âœ… Generalized: Refrain from including names, specific addresses, or other personally identifying details.
ðŸ“Œ Step 3: Identify the Personâ€™s Specific Rights Based on Their Situation After summarizing the case, provide a list of rights tailored to the specific situation, along with brief explanations to enhance understanding.
ðŸ“Œ Step 4 through Step 7: Continue with Tailored Guidance and Resources Proceed with providing detailed guidance on immediate actions, comprehensive general rights, location-specific resources, and the legal waiver to ensure that the individual is fully informed and can act appropriately.
